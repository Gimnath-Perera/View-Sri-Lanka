            We offer city and airport transfers in Sri Lanka from the Colombo
            International Airport to any location in the island. These airport
            transfers, city transfers and hotel transfers are available with a
            best rate guarantee for a certified service that ensures Euro NCAP
            certified vehicles with safety features including belts for all
            passengers, comprehensive ‘Rent A Car’ Insurance Cover (a legal
            requirement), Sri Lanka Tourist Board and ISO 9001 Certification.
            Our driver will meet you at the arrival terminal of the airport
            carrying your name-board and thereafter transport you to your
            desired location. You also have the option of retaining the vehicle
            and the driver for the rest of your trip if required. You will be
            guaranteed a pre-determined price depending on destination based on
            the standard pricing formula as well as a driver and vehicle of a
            certified standard. You will also have the benefit of not having to
            go through the hassle of dealing with touts and brokers at the
            airport. Our service is especially convenient if your arrival or
            departure is at a late or early hour when airport transport options
            are limited. Transport arrangements can also be made for transit
            passengers arriving in Sri Lanka.
