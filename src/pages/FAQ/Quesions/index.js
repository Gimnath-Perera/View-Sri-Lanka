              do without the area codes.

              your taste, if a little strong. If you long for a good espresso,
              you may get it while in Colombo but not elsewhere.

              fish or sprats (anchovies). However, the ‘South Indian’ vegetarian
              restaurants are purely vegetarian.

              You aren’t allowed to use cammara at the frescoes at Sigiriya, but
              where there is no ban, please behave responsibly. Never pose
              beside or in front of a Buddha statue (i.e. with your back to the
              statue). Such conduct is considered extremely disrespectful also
              dont try to take a photo in front os loard buddha's statue with
              people. Don’t photograph a monk without asking permission.

              Can I photographs inside temples and monasteries?
            </h3>
            <p class='mt-2 text-base text-gray-600 sm:text-lg md:text-normal'>
              Ask permission before taking pictures either of people or inside
              temples or other sacred places. For example, it is forbidden to
              take photographs inside the cave temple complex of Dambulla. Never
              use flash on murals inside temples and other places; it can cause
              damage them.

            <p class='mt-2 text-base text-gray-600 sm:text-lg md:text-normal'>
              Ask permission before taking photographs of people and respect
              their decision if they refuse. Minority groups in particular are
              often unhappy to be photographed. If photos are taken, kindly send
              back copies (through our tour leaders or direct to the village) so
              that the people receive copies.

              What if I travel out of season?
            </h3>
            <p class='mt-2 text-base text-gray-600 sm:text-lg md:text-normal'>
              Out of season travel has its own benefits; while the big crowds go
              away, most airfares & accommodation prices too go down, with many
              special offers thrown in. On the coast the average temperature
              remains around 27°C. The temperature rapidly falls as the altitude
              gets higher & higher.

              Sri Lanka experiences two monsoons; the rainy season in the East
              coast is the dry season in the south west coast & vice versa. This
              makes Sri Lanka a year around destination, and there is always a
              ‘right’ season somewhere in the island.

              Your housekeeping staff, doorman, bellboy all expect a little tip.
              A tip between 100 – 200 rupees ( 1-2 USD) for each service is
              considered adequate. You guide or driver on tour will expect

              Always give and receive and eat with your right hand. It is
              extremely bad mannered to use your left hand for eating. Respect
