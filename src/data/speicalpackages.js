It is located 43 km (30 mi) away from the ancient monastic city of Anuradhapura.
        At 766 m (2,513 ft) above sea level, and 600 m (2,000 ft) above the surrounding plains, Ritigala is the highest mountain in northern Sri Lanka. The modern name Ritigala is derived from the ancient name Ariṭṭha Pabbata (Dreadful Mountain), mentioned in the Mahavamsa
        Its elevation is higher than the other main tourist attractions of the north central plains, namely Sigiriya, Dambulla and Mihintale. The significance of this topographical feature lies in the abrupt sheerness of the massif, its wooded slopes and wet microclimate at the summit. During the North East monsoon (December to February), Ritigala experiences the highest rainfall (125 cm) of entire dry zone
        The ruins of Ritigala monastery are located on the eastern side of the mountain at the foot of the gorge which separates the main peak from the northern ridge of the range. The ruins cover an area of 24 hectares (59 acres). The monastery precinct begins at the office of the on-site branch of Department of Archeology of Sri Lanka close to the foot of the reservoir named Banda Pokuna. The ancient man-made reservoir is a feat of engineering with a bund of polygonal plan completing a circumference of 366 meters.[8] The construction of the reservoir is credited to King Pandukabhaya (437 -367 BC). The reservoir possibly served a ritual bathing purpose, with visitors bathing there before entering the monastery.
        The edge of the reservoir is followed in a clockwise direction to arrive at the other bank, and cross the bed of the stream feeding the reservoir. The steep steps here onwards lead up to a beautifully constructed pavement, a stone path 1.5 meters wide that meander upwards through the forest, linking the major buildings of the monastery.

The tank is of historical importance, having been built by King Mahasen in third century AD. The park is a dry season feeding ground for the elephant population dwelling in forests of Matale, Polonnaruwa, and Trincomalee districts.

        As advised by Lord Shiva, King Rama installed four Shivalingas at four different places namely Manavari, Thiru Koneshwaram, Thiru Ketheshwaram and Rameswaram in India to get rid of Brahmahatya Dosha. About 6 km from Chilaw, Manavari Temple is the first place where King Rama installed and prayed the Shivalinga. It is called as Ramalingam as it was erected by Rama.

        The Portuguese destroyed this temple and it was only restored in the early 1900s after the original Siva Linga was excavated. Before it was destroyed, it was supposed to be the largest of the Siva temples in Sri Lanka. Considering that the Mannar Fort, the churches in Mannar, and the Hammershield Fort at Kayts were built with stones from the demolished temple, you can imagine how huge the original temple would have been.

        Legend has it that Ravana’s mother who performed Siva Linga puja daily couldn’t find a Siva Linga to perform puja one day. To help her complete the puja, Ravana went to Dakshina Kailasam and performed penance for a Siva Linga. Upon receiving no response, he got angry and tried to lift the mountain but was pummeled by Lord Siva. He didn’t learn his lesson, pulled out his sword and inflicted a huge cut in the hill (Ravana cut) for which he was punished by Lord Siva. To pacify Lord Siva, Ravana fashioned a veena from his head and arms and sang hymns in his honor. Lord Siva was pleased and gave him his blessings and a Siva Linga.                It is also believed that this was the place where Lord Rama installed the second lingam after Manavari Temple in order to get rid of the Brahmahathya Dosham.

Over the many years, historians and archaeologists have been unable to confirm the identity of the statue but many believe that this statue is that of King Parakramabahu while others believe that it belongs to Rishi Pulasthi. It is the presence of Brahmanical sacred thread that runs from the left shoulder across the body of the statue that confirms that the statue, in fact, is that of Rishi Pulasthi.

        After lunch, we will visit another grate site of Ravana story, that is Ritigala mountain.  According to popular belief, non-human Lord Hanuman of supernatural powers, traveled over Ritigala, and, by accident, dropped a chunk off a mountain of the Himalaya range he was carrying from India to Lanka for its medicinal herbs. Lord Rama's brother, Prince Lakshmana was mortally wounded in battle and only a rare herb in the Himalaya could save his life. The pocket of vegetation of healing herbs and plants at the strange mini-plateau at the summit of Ritigala, which is distinct from the dry-zone flora of the lower slopes and surrounding plains at Ritigala, could thus be accounted for.
        Lord Hanuman has visited Lanka on a previous occasion. That was when he was sent by Lord Rama in search of his consort Sita. It was King Ravana, who seized Sita from Parnasali in India, the holy hut of Lord Rama and brought her to Asok Vana, a beautiful park at Seetha Eliya (close to Nuwara Eliya or Little England, as the British called it three millennia later) on the Pusparaga (Dadumonara) in an air chariot, without touching her. (The peacock logo of Air Lanka, the predecessor of SriLankan Airlines and successor of Air Ceylon, is a stylized version of Rawana’s air chariot.) Having found the location where Sita was held, Hanuman made use of Ritigala Kanda as a launching pad to take a leap across to South India. Incidentally, Ritigala is the highest prominence between the central plains of Sri Lanka and the coast of southern India.

The name Ramboda is also associated with Rama’s army as this was also the place where the two armies faced each other for the first time, Lord Rama’s army on the Ramboda hillside and Ravana’s on the other side, separated by the Ramboda Lake.
        There is a pond called ‘Sita Tear Pond’ nearby, which is said to be formed from Seetha Devi’s tears. Situated at Ramboda Pass, Ramboda Falls is a mesmerizing waterfall which cascades down from a height of about 109 m. It is one of the highest waterfalls in Sri Lanka
        With this morning hours, we will visit another grate place related with Rawana legend. That is Mani Kattuther Rock Labookelle, This is a rock in the Labookelle estate. Lord Hanuman met Sitadevi and on his way to announce this happy information to Lord Rama, rested on this hill top. The hilltop where Lord Hanuman is believed to have rested after meeting Sitadevi is known as Mani Kattuther. Today an open temple with statues of Lord Rama, Sitadevi, Lakshmana and Lord hanuman stands on top of it. Locals visit the temple often.
        After lunch we will visit another two sites around Ramboda area, related with Ravana story, one is Ravana Goda, It is a place where Sitadevi stayed during her transit. This area is also linked with tunnels and caves, which runs through to other parts of King Ravana’s kingdom. This is situated in the Kotmala area opposite to Ramboda rock. The main cave entrance was closed by an earth-slip in 1947. Locals believe this part of the complex was used as a prison by Ravana. The cave complex has not been fully explored. And Kothmale, When King Ravana was taking Sitha Devi to Sitha Eliya on his chariot; Sitha Devi dropped the vitaminized rice balls along the journey King Ravana gave her as refreshment. So, Lord Rama can find where she was taken. Kothmale is a place where you can still see these rice balls (Sitha Goli) that the locals now use as a cure for stomach disorders and headaches and as a charm that brings prosperity.

        The stream that runs from the hill, catered to the needs of Sitadevi during her stay at Ashok Vatika. She is said to have bathed in this stream. About a century ago of three idols were discovered in the stream, one of which was that of Sita. It is believed that the idols have been worshipped at this spot for centuries.
        Now there is temple for Lord Rama, Sitadevi, Luxshmana, and Hanuman by the side of this stream. It is interesting to note that foot prints akin to Lord Hanuman’s are found by this river and some are of small size and some are of large size, which tells us of the immense powers of hanuman transforming himself into any size.
        Divurumpola Temple – The sacred site where Sita Devi took her oath and performed the Agni Pariksha
        The next day, I visited the Divurumpola temple which is located 20 kilometers from Nuwara Eliya on the road to Welimada. Legend has it that Sita Devi performed the Agni Pariksha at this place and there is a temple there to mark the spot. The word ‘Divurumpola’, itself meant ‘place of oath’ in Sinhala. The temple is very famous for Sita Devi’s oath and the locals accept oaths made at this temple as a means to settle disputes! The Bodhi tree present in the complex is a descendant of the sapling of the Sri Maha Bodhi at Bodh Gaya – the tree under which Lord Buddha attained Enlightenment.
        Gayathri Peedam
        Gayathri peedam is believed to be the place from where King Ravana’s son Meghanath propitiated Lord Shiva with penance and pooja’s and in turn was granted super natural powers by Lord Shiva. This is the first and the foremost temple built for Gayathri Amman in Sri Lanka, and the Shiva Lingam found in this temple was brought from the holy river Narmada. This is situated in the Nuwaraeliya town.
